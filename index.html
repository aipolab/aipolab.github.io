        <h1>Artificial Intelligence Privacy and Optimization Lab</h1>
        <p>
          Directed by Dr.&nbsp;Xinyue&nbsp;Zhang, our lab explores the intersection
          of artificial intelligence, privacy preservation, secure
          communications and quantum computing. We focus on federated learning,
          deep learning model compression, ensemble learning, explainable AI,
          and large language models (LLMs) to build trustworthy and efficient
          algorithms for tomorrow's intelligent systems.

        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>
          We investigate communication‑efficient federated learning,
          privacy preservation in machine learning, AI in medical
          applications and large language models.

        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          Our work extends to secure wireless communications, cyber‑physical
          systems and data‑driven optimizations, ensuring that sensitive
          information remains protected.

        <h3>Optimization</h3>
        <p>
          We push the boundaries of quantum machine learning and explore
          privacy‑aware optimisation techniques for emerging computing
          platforms.
