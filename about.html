      <h2>About the Lab</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          The Artificial Intelligence Privacy and Optimization (AIPO) Lab is a
          research group at Kennesaw State University dedicated to advancing
          the science of trustworthy artificial intelligence. Our mission is
          to develop new theories and systems that respect user privacy,
          leverage data efficiently and optimise performance across diverse
          computing platforms. We draw on methods from federated learning,
          deep learning model compression techniques, ensemble learning,
          explainable AI, large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented
          generation (RAG) technologies, and quantum computing to address real‑world challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          By bridging the gap between theory and practice, our lab aims to
          make next‑generation intelligent systems more secure, robust and
          socially responsible. Students and collaborators work together on
          interdisciplinary projects that push the boundaries of what is
          possible in privacy‑preserving learning and optimisation.

          <p>
            Dr.&nbsp;Xinyue&nbsp;Zhang is an Assistant Professor in the Department of
            Computer Science at Kennesaw State University. Her research
            interests span cybersecurity, privacy‑preserving machine
            learning and quantum computing. Her contributions have been
            recognised by top venues such as AAAI, IEEE Big Data, IEEE
            TDSC, IEEE TMC and IEEE TWC. She is a recipient of the NSF
            CRII Award (2024). She earned her Ph.D. in Electrical and
            Computer Engineering from the University of Houston in 2021
            and holds bachelor degrees from Beijing Jiaotong University
            and KU Leuven.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside the lab, Dr.&nbsp;Zhang actively serves the research
            community as a programme committee member for major
            conferences—including AAAI and IJCAI—and as a reviewer for
            several high‑impact journals. She is passionate about mentoring
            students and fostering an inclusive and collaborative research
            environment.
